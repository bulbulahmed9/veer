# Veer PSD to HTML

This project is a **PSD to HTML conversion** that I completed as a beginner learning web development. It showcases my early practice in translating a Photoshop design into a static, responsive web page using HTML and CSS.

## Features
- Semantic HTML structure
- CSS for styling and layout
- Cross-browser compatible (basic)
- Static webpage based on the original PSD design

## Live Demo
You can view the live site here: [View Live](https://bulbulahmed9.github.io/veer/)

## Folder Structure
```
/dist/images     → image assets used in the design
/dist/css        → stylesheets
/dist/js         → Javascript
/index.html → main HTML file
```

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the webpage.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bulbulahmed9/veer.git
```

## Notes
- This project was built purely with **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS**.
- Intended for practice and educational purposes.
